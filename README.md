Project name: Energy Management Dashboard 

Description: This Energy Management Dashboard presents energy related data in an attractive and graphical format to simplify energy monitoring and present important details at a                glance, using a multi platform Web-based application.

Installation:  1- Clone the project in your editor either pycharm or vscode using git (https) 
               2- Activate your conda environment before starting to code to load the libraries required
               3- Before pushing your work to this branch , make few tests and always make sure there is no errors in your code.
               
Usage:     The dashboard will give you the overview you need to get an idea of its operationality, efficiency, capacity to save energy, using energy monitoring and targeting                  techniques such as :  1-  Monitoring energy consumption against a baseline using regression analysis.
                                 2-  CUSUM charting (CUSUM (cumulative sum control chart) is a powerful technique for illustrating energy performance of a plant or energy-                                              consuming system)
